# Tic-Tac-Toe

* This is part of my practice of exercises provided by the book _Agile Technical Practices Distilled_

Try to implement the game of Tic-Tac-Toe as good as you can by following the TDD practices we have been using so far.

Tic-Tac-Toe rules:

* X always goes first
* Players alternate placing X's and O's on the board
* A player with three X's or O's in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins
* If all nine squares are filled and neither player achieves three in a row, the game is a draw
